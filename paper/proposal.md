## REINFORCEMENT LEARNING 
<br/>

<p>Reinforcement learning(RL) is a well-known method for making consecutive decisions in the face of uncertainty. A typical RL algorithm only has a limited understanding of the environment and receives little input on the quality of its decisions. Learning agents must be able to construct meaningful abstractions, or the ability to selectively ignore unimportant information, in order to function effectively in complicated contexts. I'd want to present a hierarchical RL framework that includes an algebraic framework for describing task-specific abstraction in this study. RL is concerned with the ability to learn links between inputs, behaviors, and the occurrence of pleasant or painful events, referred to as rewards or punishments.</p>

<br/>

<p>So frequently have we heard about self-driving vehicles or robots exceeding humans, or a computer game overcoming the best of the champions in this era of automation! Yes, these are some of the most beautiful and complicated Deep Reinforcement Learning applications. The purpose of this paper is to introduce the idea of reinforcement learning.</p>

<p>True, Big Data is a driving force behind many technologies' ability to do previously unthinkable feats, but as more data is collected, processing, extracting, and working with it becomes more difficult. However, I'd want to use the results of this study to specify how alternative data analytics methodologies may be applied to the RL model.The term reinforcement indicates the process of forming and strengthening of these associations by the reinforcer, which encompasses both rewards (positive reinforcers) and punishments (negative reinforcers). These associations affect the learner’s behavior in a variety of fashions: they shape vegetative and automatic responses as a function of reward and punishment anticipation and they also bias learner’s actions.</p>
